				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>
					The idea of creating <strong>RandomCollection</strong> emerged when I was thinking about a way to
					<strong>collect</strong> and organise small private coding projects. In addition, I was looking for
					a way to centrally preserve <strong>random</strong> notes about various topics that would otherwise
					get lost in the depth of my computer. The requirement of having this <strong>random
					collection</strong> available at all times, device-independent, and without the need of any login,
					combined with my general interest in building a website, lead to the creation of
					<strong>RandomCollection</strong>.

				<h2>Who?</h2>
				<p>
					I am an economist and econometrician with a passion for providing actionable insights of the highest
					quality for a wide range of business problems within the credit risk context. I utilise
					state-of-the-art analytics and technology to enable sound data-driven decision making. Currently, I
					am working as a risk analytics and modelling manager for a Fortune Global 500 company in the
					financial industry. It was only in my current role that I really got my hands into coding, and I
					especially fell in love with Python.
